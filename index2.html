    <p> The goal of this project is to understand the tool, make 2D drawings, and transfer it into a 3D model. My tool is a food mill. In the object drawing, I explore the funtion, measurement, and nature of the tool. The drawing includes four sections and two elevations. The final composition has a center, which is the hanging point. In order to show its function, I drafted views from both top and bottom of the tool. The sections explains its structure, its rotating handle, and its blade.
    <p> Then, I explore motions of the tool, the subject, and the actor. I used verbs as rotate, torque, mill, fall, and pile to describe the food mill. With different line weight, I show its indensity, force, and direction.
    <p> Finally, I worked with a parter, Erin Fuller, to transfer our drawings into 3D models. We cut sections from each drawing and then connect the two. The final model includes two parts: the stepping base and the hanging clode-like cap.

      <h3>Model Making</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Step 3: Transfer 2D drawings into a 3D model</p>
      <p>The final model is made of wood. It contains various systems. The curved upper part is treated as a subassemblies. Different layers are glued together. It is attached to the middle zig-zag stepping section with two knots. The last three layers, 7/8'' each, is inserted into the base. The base is cut according to the extended lines of the middle part. The base creates a further hierarchy for the stepping. </p>
